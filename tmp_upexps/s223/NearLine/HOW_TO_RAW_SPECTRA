    If you need to check the raw spectra of the different 
    detectors you might want to use the DrawRaw.C routine

    This routine take as an input the tree produces by the 
    UCESB unpacker.

    Up to now only the NTF,TFW, Xb and POS are available.
    upgrade of this file if there will be some : 
    /u/land/unpackexps/s223/NearLine/HOW_TO_RAW_SPECTRA


    A - *** First step : CREATE THE TREE ***




    Go into the unpackexps/s223 directory.

unpackexps/s223>. cernlogin pro
unpackexps/s223>./s223 /misc/scratch.land1/s223/lmd/file.lmd --ntuple=UNPACK,camac_tpat,RAW,XXX,ntuple.ntu

    where XXX is the abreviation for the detector(s) you
    want to look at. Here are the different abreviation:
       big TofWall    : TFW
       small TofWall  : NTF
       Fiber detectors: GFI
       Crystal Ball   : XB
       Silicon        : SST
       pos            : POS
       psp            : PSP
       land           : N
       scintillators  : SCI

unpackexps/s223>. rootlogin pro
unpackexps/s223>h2root ntuple.ntu

    => This will create a root file called ntuple.root
    which contains a TTree named h101. Move this file
    to the NearLine directory

unpackexps/s223>mv ntuple.root NearLine

    I would strongly recommend to remove the ntuple.ntu
    file after it has been converted into root file, or
    if you want to look at it in PAW, please move it to
    the Analyse directory.

unpackexps/s223>rm ntuple.ntu



    B - *** Second step : PLAY WITH ROOT ***




    Go into the NearLine directory

unpackexps/s223>cd NearLine

    you first need to launch root. Then you can use the
    macro DrawRaw.C: compile it and execute it. Up to now
    this macro draw the raw spectra for the TFW, NTF, XB.
    

unpackexps/s223/NearLine>root -l
root[0] .L DrawRaw.C
root [1] run()
What is the name of the root file you want to read ?
>>>>GIVE THE FILE NAME

Which detectors you want to check ?
XB, TFW, NTF (use OK if you want to quit)
>>>>GIVE THE NAME : ntf usw...

Which Tpat for the NTF ? 
>>>>GIVE THE TPAT NUMER
Please wait ... ... 

NTF done. Next detector please ?
>>>>ok or other detectors

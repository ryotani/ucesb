#         HOW TO DO THE MERGING OF UCESB AND LAND02             #

   If you need to do correlation between one of these 3 detectors :
   DCH, NTF and SST and the rest of the calibrated land setup, you 
   need to merge the trees coming from the unpacker UCESB (which
   will provide RAW data from DCH, NTF and SST) and from land02
   analysis code (which will provide calibrated data). The upgrade
   of this HOW_TO will available under:
   /u/land/unpackexps/s223/NearLine/HOW_TO_CORRELATION

   There are two options to do the merging.





I- OPTION 1 : MergeNoChange.C

   This is simple like "Hello". You need to create the trees from
   UCESB and from LAND02 as it is describe in the part A of the 
   OPTION 2.

   Then go in the NearLine directory:

unpackexps/s223/NearLine> root -l
root[0] .L MergeNoChange.C+
root [1] addfriend()
 ADDING THE h509 TREE (land02) AS FRIEND OF h101 TREE (UCESB) 
 Please, check that Eventno and Evnt coincides at the begginng and end! 
Name of the Root File from the UCESB: 
run_166_2692_ucesb.root
Name of the Root File from the LAND02: 
run_166_2692_land02.root

   Here we are. You have a TTree h101 which as a TTree friend "h509".
   If all the variables do not have the same name: keine Problemen !
   See an example below of usage.

root [2] new TBrowser
(class TBrowser*)0x8c56b20
root [3] h101->Draw("Sst1e","Evnt==29123123")   

   




II- OPTION 2

   Very simple as well ! But a bit more long to process. This will
   change a bit the format of the trees for the NTF and SST. The new
   format will have a fix length, meaning if you want to look at the 
   NTF and SST just directly from the prompter and look at X versus Y
   witjout loop, you can do it. The format of the tree is in the par C.



   A - *** First step : CREATE THE TREES ***


   A1 - Go into the unpackexps/s223 directory.


unpackexps/s223>. cernlogin pro
unpackexps/s223>./s223 /misc/scratch.land1/s223/lmd/file.lmd --ntuple=UNPACK,camac_tpat,camac\\_tcal\\_info_info,EVENTNO,TRIGGER,RAW,NTF,SST,USER,CCB,run_XXX_XXXX_UCESB.ntu
unpackexps/s223>. rootlogin pro
unpackexps/s223>h2root ntuple_ucesb.ntu

   =>This will create a root file run_XXX_XXXX_UCESB.root in which 
   you will have a TTree called h101. To gain some places and mainly 
   to keep the s223 directory clean, I would strongly recommended to 
   remove the .NTU FILES after they have been converted in root files. 
   Or if you want to look at them with PAW please copy them into the 
   Analyse directory.


   A2 - Go into the land02/s223 directory.

land02/s223>./paw_ntuple /misc/scratch.land1/s223/lmd/file.lmd --paw-ntuple=HIT,TRACK,SCI,POS,PSP,GFI,TFW,run_XXX_XXXX_LAND02.ntu
land02/s223>h2root run_XXX_XXXX_LAND02.ntu

   => This will create a root file run_XXX_XXXX_LAND02.root in which 
   you will have a TTree called h509. Same remarks, do not leave any 
   .NTU FILE in the land02/s223 directory please.





   B - *** Second step : MERGE THE TREES ***


   B1 - Move the Trees in the unpackexps/s223/NearLine directory.


unpackexps/s223>mv run_XXX_XXXX_UCESB.root NearLine
land02/s223>mv run_XXX_XXXX_LAND02 ../../unpackexps/s223/NearLine

   B2 - Go into the NearLine directory


unpackexps/s223/NearLine> root -l
root[0].L Merge.C+
root[1]run()
Name of the Root File from the UCESB: 
run_XXX_XXXX_UCESB.root                         //enter the name of your root file and press enter
Name of the Root File from the LAND02: 
run_XXX_XXXX_LAND02.root                        //enter the name of your root file and press enter
Which name for the output root file would you like (run_XXX_XXXX.root or whatever ...)
run_XXX_XXXX.root                               //enter the name of the output root file you want
